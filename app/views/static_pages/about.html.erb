<h9>About Penn Explorers</h9>
<br>
<p> The most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. - H.P. Lovecraft </p>

<br>
<p>Much of the world lives day to day unaware of the potential that their minds are capable of. Without filters, without bounds, without conditioning, and without delusion our minds have the ability to be limitless entities that can perceive extraordinarily complex concepts. Instead of our awareness jumping wholly from one fleeting thought to the next, there are many methods that humans have been using for centuries to converge the concepts of our consciousness. The most important thing we need is an awakening to be able to see what is truly most valuable and important in our lives. Penn Explorers is the catalyst to open eyes and doors for minds everywhere. </p>
<br>
<h9>What We Do</h9>

<p>(1) You can participate in a research project that will attempt to have you enter slightly altered states of being. Often times, this can be eye-opening. </p> 
<p>(2) You can choose to have a deconditioning session done on you. </p>
